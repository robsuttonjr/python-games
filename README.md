Python PyGames

On 08/07/2025 OpenAI released chatGPT 5.  I told it to create me a Diablo 2 like game.  It created an interesting game although very basic, still pretty cool for a 15 minute little test!

The next day I decided to create Tetros haha that is what it called my Tetris like game.  From there I am just going to whip up games for fun and upload them.  I always wanted to create my own video games and now I can just by describing it in plain english!
