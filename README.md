Python PyGames

On 08/07/2025 OpenAI released chatGPT 5.  I told it to create me a Diablo 2 like game.  It created an interesting game although very basic, still pretty cool for a 15 minute little test!

The next day I decided to create Tetros haha that is what it called my Tetris like game.  From there I am just going to whip up games for fun and upload them.  I always wanted to create my own video games and now I can just by describing it in plain english!

With AI there is no end to what we can create!  No longer limited by our own knowledge.  Our imagination is only limited by the capacity of AI which now with chatGPT 5 and othe AI's, is nearly unlimited!

As I modify and improve the games I will increment the number to show the evolution of the game.
